                <p>
                  I am a software engineer with 8 years of professional experience. I believe in being self-sufficient
                  and I always try to stay up-to-date with the technologies I use. I think that as software engineers,
                  we are there to solve problems, and we should be able to quickly learn and adapt to whatever is
                  required in order to complete the task.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I studied software engineering at the Software University in Sofia, Bulgaria during high school
                  (remotely) and landed my first job at Oxxy just 2 weeks after graduation. My main area of expertise is
                  fullstack web development with Angular, React, Next.js, Vue and Node.js. I&apos;ve also used React
                  Native and a bit of Ionic. Throughout the years I&apos;ve had the pleasure to work on various
                  projects, getting exposed to a wide variety of technologies which I believe is really beneficial as it
                  expands one&apos;s grasp.
